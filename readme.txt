=== Items of Note ===
* This Theme does not use Custom Header Images
* Functions prefixed with 'bns_' are common to all themes created by myself and are representative of their home pages at http://BuyNowShop.com/themes/
* Posts without titles can be reached by clicking on the linked 'Comment' reference
* Posts without titles and password protected will not have a direct link to the single view of the post.
* Author email link will only appear on 'author.php' rendered pages if their website URL has been added to their profile.

=== F.A.Q. ===
Q: Why is the theme not using the WordPress core search form since Ground Floor version 2.1?
The update routine for WordPress themes overwrites the existing files with the files found in the updated version of the theme. If a file is removed in an update it must be manually removed from the website afterward. This does not affect new (re-)installation of the theme.

=== TO-DO ===
[x] Review internationalization for proper support or possible removal (remove 'translation-ready' tag until decided)
[ ] Review stylesheet for editor style (as needed?)
[ ] Review posts without title and password protected ... expect as a very rare use-case and not an immediate requirement at this time
